## On-chain Program

The on chain Audances Perpetual program maintains the vAMM state as well as a compressed liquidation index-addressable record of all open positions. It manages the creation of user accounts, the opening, closing and modifying of positions. It implements a constant-time liquidation engine which allows for a complete liquidation cycle at each Solana slot.

## Insurance fund protection

- Fallback insurance is multi sig locked
- Small effective insurance fund is owned by the program

## vAMM State

- Seed Nonce for vAMM signer program account
- Oracle address
- Audaces signer address
- Insurance fund holdings
- Vec of (
  leverage,
  (short_pt, long_pt),
  gc_hd_pt,
  Vec of (Pubkey, PageInfo) for position_books
  )

vAMM == MARKET

## Cranker

Perpetual nodes secure the Audaces protocol by cranking transactions. Anyone can run a node and help secure the protocol. The cranking transactions are:

- Liquidations
- Funding rates
- Funding extraction
- Garbage collection

üí° The cranker can be deployed on a small VPS, for instance an [AWS LightSail VPS](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail) or a [Bahnhof VPS](https://www.bahnhof.net).

### Cranking with Ansible

The repository contains an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbook to automate the entire set up of the server. In order to deploy the cranker, you will only need to change the `hosts.yaml` file. For example, let's say you want to deploy a cranker in two AWS zones: Dublin and Tokyo, the `hosts.yaml` file could look like

```yaml
tokyo:
  hosts:
    tokyo_1:
      ansible_host: ip_of_your_server
      ansible_ssh_private_key_file: path_to_your_ssh_key_file

dublin:
  hosts:
    dublin_1:
      ansible_host: ip_of_your_server
      ansible_ssh_private_key_file: path_to_your_ssh_key_file
```

You also need to setup the wallet with which you want to crank using the `wallet.json` file in the `cranker` folder. You can then deploy your node using Ansible by running the following commands

- For the first time set up of your server use:

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts.yaml setup.yaml
```

- To update your node

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts.yaml update.yaml
```

You can monitor your node using [pm2-metrics](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2-metrics) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) using a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) datasource

### Cranking locally

If you want to crank on your local machine and already have Rust installed you can simply run the following

```
cd cranker
cargo build --release
target/release/./perps-crank --url <rpc_endpoint> --market <market_address> --program-id <program_id> --fee-payer <path_to_your_wallet> <service>
```

Where `<service>` is in: `funding`, `funding-extraction`, `liquidate` and `garbage-collect`

To install Rust on your machine refer to [https://rustup.rs/](https://rustup.rs/)

One can also use the process manager [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to launch the crankers

```
yarn global add pm2
<!-- Or with NPM -->
npm install pm2 -g
```

### Cranking incentives

| Cranker            | Reward                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Liquidate          | 10% of the position's collateral |
| Garbage Collect    | 0.1 USDC per freed slot          |
| Funding            | None                             |
| Funding Extraction | None                             |

## JS Library

A JavaScript client library for interacting with the on-chain program. This library can be used for:

- Creating markets
- Trading on a market
- Fetching market data
- Cranking (Rust sample code is recommended ‚ö†Ô∏è)

To install it

```
npm i @audaces/perps
```

```
yarn add @audaces/perps
```

The JS Library documentation can be generated using

```
yarn doc
```
